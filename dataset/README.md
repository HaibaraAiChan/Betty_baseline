### Full graph data
The original full graph Datasets come from:
https://github.com/dglai/dgl-0.5-benchmark  Node classification category.

### Full batch data
In this folder, we will save the generated full batch data (sampling from full graph based on fanout size)  
For example, the full batch data of **fanout 10,25** will save to folder `fan_out_10,25/`
